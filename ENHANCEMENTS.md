## Why the Screenshot Might Not Show on GitHub

The screenshot in the README might not be displaying for the following reasons:

1. **File Format Issues**: The screenshot.png file might not be in a web-compatible format
2. **File Size**: The image might be too large for GitHub's display limitations
3. **Path Issues**: The relative path in the README might not correctly point to the image
4. **Git LFS**: Large image files might require Git LFS (Large File Storage) to be properly tracked

## How to View the Enhancements

1. Run the test dashboard: `python3 -m http.server 8080` then visit http://localhost:8080/test-dashboard.html
2. Or view the mockup: http://localhost:8080/dashboard-mockup.html

The enhanced dashboard shows real-time arbitrage opportunities with:
- Timestamp of detection
- Token pair (e.g., "ETH/USDC")
- Profit percentage
- Potential earnings in USD
- Protocols involved (e.g., "Uniswap V2 â†’ Sushiswap")
- Confidence level of the opportunity
